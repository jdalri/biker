get a list of cities (PLACES API)
get the total distance for the travel (DISTANCE MATRIX API) (fazer uma chamada para cada par de origem/destino)
  ex.:
    cidades: nt, sjb, bq
    1 chamada nt > sjb
    1 chamada sjb > bq
    assim vou saber a distancia/tempo entre nt e sjb e entre sjb e bq


show the markers on the map (MAPS API)

the user starts a journey, then select the origin point and the final destination (might have multiple destinations between),
then he gets the information and then he starts the journey.

once the journey is initiated, the user can add data as to how much he's traveled (KM) and then get updated as to how long he still has to go.
